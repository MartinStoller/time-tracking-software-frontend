# Time-Tracking-Software Frontend

My first ever Frontend Project: For learning purposes I built the Frontend for my REST API (https://github.com/MartinStoller/time-tracking-software) with React Typescript.
Once I got the hang of it and implementing more Components didnt seem to bear any more learning effect I stopped, so there are still a bunch of buttons without functionality.

This Project was done in a Group of 2, but I excluded some of the code in here, which was written by my partner so ~80% of Code in this Repo was actually written by me.
